# Advanced Software Semester 6 - Game Quiz

## Description
This individual project is being carried out for a Fontysâ€™ Advanced Software Semester 6. The focus of this project is exploring one or more topics by defining research goals, performing research activities, and applying the gained knowledge to the project. For the case of my individual project, I chose to develop a quiz game. While the project is done for the purposes of a university project, the quiz game can also be considered as an effective tool for training and education purposes. There are various similar quiz game products available in the market such as Quizizz, Kahoot, and Socrative. The quiz game lets users answer trivia questions and compare scores via a scoreboard. Users customize their session by selecting question category, difficulty, type, and number of questions. Scoreboards display overall and category scores, with one point awarded for each correct answer.


## Goal of the project
The goal of this project is to create a fun and engaging trivia quiz game that will entertain and educate players of all ages. The game will feature a variety of categories and questions that will challenge players' knowledge and keep them coming back for more. The game will also be easy to use and accessible on multiple platforms, including desktop and mobile devices. Ultimately, the goal is to create a high-quality trivia quiz game that will become a go-to source of entertainment for trivia lovers everywhere.
